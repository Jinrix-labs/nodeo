# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Code Quality

- [x] TypeScript compilation passes (`npm run build`)
- [x] No linting errors (`npm run lint`)
- [x] Production build works locally (`npm run preview`)
- [x] NVIDIA pack generates correctly
- [x] All features work in production build

### Files Ready

- [x] `package.json` - Build scripts configured
- [x] `.env.example` - Environment variables documented
- [x] `.vercelignore` - Exclude unnecessary files
- [x] `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide
- [x] `api/health.js` - Health check endpoint
- [x] Vite auto-detection - Vercel will handle configuration

### Build Process

- [x] `prebuild` script generates nvidia pack
- [x] `build` script compiles TypeScript and builds with Vite
- [x] Output directory: `dist/`
- [x] Static assets optimized for caching

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel auto-detects Vite project
5. Click "Deploy"

### 3. Environment Variables

In Vercel dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables:

```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key
```

### 4. Custom Domain (Optional)

- Go to Project Settings → Domains
- Add your custom domain
- Configure DNS as instructed

## 📊 Build Output Analysis

**Bundle Sizes:**

- Main app: ~167KB (53KB gzipped)
- NVIDIA pack: ~36KB (6KB gzipped) - loaded dynamically
- CSS: ~13KB (3KB gzipped)
- Total initial load: ~180KB (56KB gzipped)

**Performance Features:**

- ✅ Dynamic loading keeps initial bundle small
- ✅ Static assets cached for 1 year
- ✅ NVIDIA pack loads on-demand
- ✅ Full offline functionality after first load

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Testing

### Test These Features

1. **Basic Functionality**
   - [ ] App loads without errors
   - [ ] Challenge selection works
   - [ ] Language switching works
   - [ ] Code editor functions

2. **NVIDIA Pack**
   - [ ] "Load NVIDIA Pack" button works
   - [ ] 22 challenges appear after loading
   - [ ] All challenges have proper starter code
   - [ ] Code execution works for all languages

3. **Persistence**
   - [ ] Code saves automatically
   - [ ] Progress persists across page refreshes
   - [ ] Settings are remembered
   - [ ] NVIDIA pack state persists

4. **Performance**
   - [ ] Initial load is fast
   - [ ] NVIDIA pack loads quickly
   - [ ] No console errors
   - [ ] Mobile responsive

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Fails**: Check that nvidia-practice-pack directory exists
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure they start with `VITE_`
3. **TypeScript Errors**: Run `npm run build` locally first
4. **Missing Files**: Check `.vercelignore` configuration

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test build locally
npm run build
npm run preview

# Check bundle size
npm run build && ls -la dist/assets/

# Verify nvidia pack generation
npm run build:nvidia
```

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:

- ✅ App loads at your Vercel URL
- ✅ All 22 NVIDIA challenges load dynamically
- ✅ Code execution works for all languages
- ✅ User progress persists across sessions
- ✅ No console errors in production
- ✅ Mobile and desktop responsive

**Ready to deploy!** 🚀
